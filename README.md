# SW API

**Background:** This application was built as a demo of my skills for BitCine.

## Technology In Use:
- React
- Redux
- Emotion
- Cypress
- Jest

## Running Swapi-api:
Simply run: `yarn install && yarn start`

## Tests:
You can run cypress by using: `yarn test`
Jest tests were written as well, however Cypress end to end testing made more sense for the submission.
